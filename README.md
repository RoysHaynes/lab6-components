# ðŸ§© Lab 6: Chat Component

## Overview
This lab introduces **component-based thinking**, a core concept in modern web development.  
Weâ€™ll build the same **chat interface** four different ways to understand how architecture patterns, encapsulation, and progressive enhancement impact maintainability, reusability, and accessibility.

By comparing these approaches, Iâ€™ll learn how decisions about where to place structure, style, and behavior affect scalability and future design choices.

### Key Themes
- Components as self-contained UI units
- Progressive enhancement and graceful degradation
- Encapsulation with the Shadow DOM
- Comparing reusability vs. complexity across patterns

---

## Project Goals
By the end of this lab, I will have:
1. A complete chat interface implemented in **four different ways**:
    - **Prototype (HTML/CSS):** Purely visual design mock-up
    - **DOM Manipulation:** Vanilla JavaScript with event handling and Eliza-style bot
    - **Progressive Enhancement:** Custom element built on existing HTML
    - **Shadow DOM Component:** Fully encapsulated, reusable component
2. A working **Eliza-style chatbot** using simple pattern matching
3. Clean and semantic **HTML/CSS layouts**
4. Organized code structure and incremental Git commits showing development progression
5. A continuously updated README documenting design decisions and reflections

## Component Approaches

| Approach | Description | Focus |
|-----------|--------------|-------|
| **Prototype (HTML/CSS)** | Non-functional static layout | Visual design, semantic HTML |
| **DOM Manipulation** | Vanilla JS to add interactivity | Event handling, DOM updates |
| **Progressive Enhancement** | Custom element without Shadow DOM | Accessibility, graceful fallback |
| **Shadow DOM Component** | Fully encapsulated Web Component | Encapsulation, portability |

---

## Development Approach
This project will follow an **iterative, four-phase workflow** with incremental commits:
1. **Prototype:** Establish structure & style (HTML/CSS)
2. **DOM Manipulation:** Add JS logic for message flow & Eliza responses
3. **Progressive Enhancement:** Convert markup into a `<simple-chat>` custom element
4. **Shadow DOM:** Create `<chat-interface>` with encapsulated styles and behavior

Each step will include a short reflection added to this README.

## Design Decisions (to document as lab progresses)

---

## Comparing the Approaches (to be filled out)
Note differences in code organization
Consider reusability of each approach
Think about maintenance and debugging
Reflect on when you'd use each approach
